 Okay, awesome. There we go. We got the recording block in the voice channel.
 Alright, I'll just start.
 talking, um, let me think. What have I been experimenting with lately? Um, it's been mostly.
 my usual routine in like just getting sun immediately the moment that I wake up and then in regards to herbs I've been really
 focusing on maximizing essentially mostly dopamine just so I can get as much work done throughout the day as possible because I've been working on getting a new
 shipment to our oh my bad sorry if you heard that alarm let me turn those off real quick I've been working on getting a new shipment sent to the fulfillment center for Grimspoth to carry
 And there's been very time consuming with trying to balance that between taking care of my family when they were sick. They're finally feeling better, which is. It's been a major relief.
 on my shoulders but it is what it is it's life yeah I learned that it's just been the same
 Some might expose myself to the natural weather, depending on the season. So, it's been mostly cold. There's been like, we'll get a week here and there of sun and warmth and then...
 immediately goes to cloudy and fold. So I've just been swapping between that. It's been nice, but I'm just looking forward to the regular sun in warmth that comes with, or should be coming with...
 Let me check the... Okay, so we got some questions rolling in. Yes, asked.
 Oh, hold on, we respond to this decky guy. Let's see here.
 Okay, which herbs are your favorite for dopamine agonism?
 um lately i've been utilizing uh... potu-abba bark blue lotus marappuama as like the foundation and then the supporting urbe
 are things like Sumerute, Luthiro. I've been really enjoying that sabroxy herbal extract from a roxilum in the come that no tropis depot provides.
 has, I believe it's called a Roxle and A as the primary constituent. It's been very useful. It's been very useful. It's like it's very similar to Kato Abu Bak in the
 that it's like a very pure dopamine reuptake inhibitor but it also has some very mild GABA GABA A
 negative allosteric modulation. So it reduces the sensitivity to GABA, to the receptors. So it's, it can be a little bit angiogenic or anxiety-induced.
 in some people that are more sensitive, but that's balanced out by the bicaillin and bicellin, which are gabbit positive alosteric modulators. So they resensitize gabbit receptors to
 your induction is gamma. Aside from that, I've been really enjoying that, it's a usual in my stack is the,
 The pagan of harm all that I usually put into my herbal coffee Hold on let me pull up the I still take notes of my intake just out of habit
 So my herbal coffee has My herbal coffee has been blue lotus butterfly pee Chinese cats claw Chinese school cat
 FOTE lemon meriddle, which is a... it's like an anabolic herb that I've been experimenting with a little bit. I'll probably write more about it. I found some studies in rodents where it increases the...
 satellite cells in the muscles, which is the potential for growth in the muscles. So that's been... It seems to be effective, but it's not like a steroid obvious...
 The Muayra Puama, the Katsuo of Babark, Polygala, Porya Mushroom is something else that I've been experimenting with for kidney health and blood pressure regulation. Serien.
 and Woodbethney so the pharmacologist kind of all over the place with my herbal coffee but it balances itself out fairly well. That's pretty much the uh...
 the gist of the the herbal stack that I've been working with it's a little complex because there's so many regulatory pathways to inhibiting like full dopamine potential.
 wouldn't necessarily recommend it because it can make people, it can make some people manic, but that it hasn't been the case for me because of the more calming and regulatory herbs that I include.
 And how goes the experimentation with the lithium metaborate? So this one I've had.
 the compound for a very long time and then I finally made a solution with it and it's essentially it's just a mix between lithium and boron. There's nothing really unique about it in the sense that
 Like there's no unique effects compared to taking either one separate. It just makes it a little bit more convenient. So it's... The combination of it, I believe, is very effective for...
 kidney protection. It's very effective in stimulating stem cells for specific parts of the body, like lithium in general, and then with the boron attachment, it's very effective for
 the skeletal system, the kidneys, the pituitary gland, the hormones. Yeah, it's been useful, but like I said, I...
 first human. I'm aware of it has uh, trialled it so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it compared to just taking either one separately. Weird obscure issue on trying to figure out.
 Went through a ton of what I believe now is the dreamless stress last year and my whole life really and during the worst episode I seem to grow a ton of body hair I also develop a lot of dandruff on my scalp and hair loss. What do you think the mech?
 for this happening, any advice on getting my body back to homeostasis other than addressing knee journals? No one's a little bit tricky with...
 With body hair, I've noticed dihydro testosterone or DHT and then elevated thyroid hormones, which can become elevated with stress.
 infections so like if you were sick around that period it it it got it ties back to what I was talking about with youth thyroid sick syndrome on the Twitter
 timeline recently where it elevates your thyroid stimulating hormone but without really messing around with like T3 or T4. So that will have a
 downstream effect on elevating the other thyroid hormones and then that can also cause an increase in body hair. From the dandruff on the scalp and hair loss that's um...
 It really depends on the patterning for the hair loss, like if it's on the crown that could be related to Portozole, Perlactin, and then D- I believe D-H-T.
 rises in response to other stressors rather than being the root cause of the hair loss. And then
 If it's like, hair fall coming from anywhere else on the scalp, not just the crown, it could be telogen effluvium, which is a response to stress on the body, which generally passes
 the time, but like a nutritional surplus in stress management can mitigate a lot of that. That's for the dandruff. Like stress in general, the adrenal stress can...
 have a negative impact on the gut microbiota and thus the skin microbiota but I would also be looking at your like if you don't have a shower filter that can be very helpful changing the
 sheets in the pillowcases regularly, just basic advice for skin health, hair health. But the shower filter can make a big difference particularly if you live in a city.
 where the municipal tap water is not very optimal or like if you live in a, even if you live in a rural area with a lot of hard water that can have a negative impact on the...
 microbiome of the skin as well, which can result in some of that danger of issue. Yeah, it's very tough to say on a very specific cause for something like that without...
 further detail, but those are some Things off the top of my head. Yes, if you have anything that you'd like to include there then by all means



 Yeah, that would be an excellent addition as well as well as just like the impact on the
 skin microbiome in regards to UV light and specifically. All right, Decky said, are there any herbs which would be...
 in the context of this autonomia and sympathetic nervous system act over activation, gabber herbs, dopamine herbs, etc. So yeah, in general, I did a...
 very in-depth outline on the a lot of calming and sedative herbs in the I believe it was the Gabba Urgent drug drug recovery protocol ignore the drug
 part, like if you're not tapering off any relevant substances, but there's a very in-depth review on not just the herbal medicines, but nutrient co-factors as well that can be of great help.
 in regards to dis autonomia and sympathetic nervous system over activation. And then, like ES said, just general lifestyle changes that are congruent with stress management.
 So like trying to mitigate your day to day stress it to the greatest extent possible would be very helpful in some cases that's very difficult to do like if you live in a A stressful home like the
 the relationship environment is not very optimal or a very high-stress job. You'll still want to try to increase your stress management factors in that regard just because...
 You don't want to worsen the situation, but like the nutritional and herbal support and lifestyle support will be of great help in that regard. Okay.
 I've seen Matthew said I've seen your tweets on neurogenesis where you talk about dialing in inocenthal intake, lithium intake and various herbal preparations for stem cell development.
 are those the ones outlined in the Gabba Rijik recovery protocols? Haven't found as much detail on Twitter from searching things. Yeah, so I've essentially
 I believe I've outlined them in the majority of like the GABA support protocols in general. I think the dopamine support protocols and then the...
 like the whole chapter series of the, what was it called? The drug recovery protocols were outlined for a very...
 specific receptor systems. So the GABA-ERGIC one is definitely going to be the most comprehensive in regards to like the full brain and the stem cell development doesn't only apply to the brain, but the end.
 entire body. So every organ system within the body, including the mitochondria. Yeah, it's a fairly comprehensive process, but...
 The majority of it is going to be outlined in those protocols that I've written down. I may do a more direct approach on one of the articles if you guys are interested because I know some of the articles are...
 a little bit scattered. So if you have any requests for articles by all means, I'm currently editing one that I got a request for for a joint intended health that I've been experimenting with a little bit.
 because with the heavier lifting that I've been doing, I was dealing with some knee pain and sensitivity, but I'll let you guys read over the protocol, because it does.
 There were some other factors that I found were involved just aside from mechanical stress. What are the mobile, apothecary contents? Things you carry outside the house?
 Basically I'll carry the major electrolyte salts, so like sea salt, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride. Usually I'll carry a bottle of topical magnesium.
 spray as well, a bottle of the brain tonic because the applications for that can be very wide ranging for some people that, like if you encounter someone that's like freaking out in public and...
 they're open to like having a dropper, it can have a very profound effect on calming them. Or like at a party, if you're with friends, it's something like a context similar to that.
 My mentor talked about having a methuline blue on hand, but I haven't really found a use for that yet. I usually keep it with me when I
 go to the city specifically as like a prophylactic. I carry a small bottle of black seed oil. Like I ordered these little, like, pump spray containers.
 from Amazon just so I could keep some on hand when I go to New York City just because you got to try to support your immune system to the greatest extent possible in an environment like that. And then...
 Those are really going to be the main factors. I've been carrying the lock zone on me as well just because the situation with the opioid epidemic and the knee disease.
 being more potent opioid research chemicals than fentanyl is, being widespread on the market. Nowadays has been very concerning.
 So like my wife's mother is a nurse. She's been reporting that there's been overdoses that are not responsive to Narcan and they don't come back positive for fentanyl. So I had to tell
 that the governments aware of it, they published an article on it in October of 2023, I believe, but I don't think they've alerted any of the nurses or doctors.
 like nationwide yet. Hopefully they do because it's a they just need more Narcan to reverse that type of overdose. But yeah that's another thing that I I try to keep on hand. Yes.
 Do you have anything that you like to keep in your mobile party carry?


 the i
 In major cities specifically, it's very akin to being surrounded by that much radiation. The radiation you would be surrounded by on a plane in regards to the jet lag protocol.
 had written a while back. The ubiquinol is very useful in mitigating a lot of that detriment to the mitochondria. Any recommended shower filters?
 Hold on, let me pull up. What was that one called? Let's see.
 I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room.
 Oh, the one that I was using in Phoenix was the ultimate dual KDF shower filter.
 without head. So you can just include your own shower attachment for that one. So it is a little bit bulky. The price point, it was when I was...
 buying it. We have well water here now. So it's just the hard water that we need to manage with a water softener. But it may not
 eliminate chloramine completely but it does have very powerful effect on chlorine. The price point was about 150 to 175 if I recall. I'm not sure if it's still the same.
 I believe I posted a link to it in the year. The... I think it was a mitochondrial redox protocol.
 I forget the exact title but I believe I put a link in there for the dual KDF shower filter. Yes are you aware of any other shower filters that you've seen.

 testing.
 Yeah, we've built up a very comprehensive library in this Discord channel since the beginning of it. So if you...
 I don't mind the questions, but if you're someone inclined going back and searching may be helpful as well, if it hasn't already been answered then by all means.
 Okay, so you responded to those? Yeah, the thiamine is going to be very implicating the disauto-nomia. Oh, he's already on top of it all. Awesome.
 Alphide Thompson said, do you have any advice regarding anyone dealing with post-vax damage and long COVID? 24 have been dealing with Vax injury since 2021 and also long COVID now.
 My main issue with chest pain, cardiac chest pain, but no definitive diagnosis, but likely paracarditis with the way it represents POTS palpitations, heart flutters, MCAS, histamine issues.
 chronic GI issues tonight is what feels like autoimmune issues and had a positive I jammed for brilliant more. Okay, so that was probably a typo. I'm trying my best to do all the right things.
 but I'm struggling severely still bed and housebound. So I would just start with the basics with the foundation if you have an RD. With the environment that's going to be a major.
 factor, especially in regards to your EMF situation, because that can trigger or exacerbate or worsen the autoimmune symptoms, which...
 Like the MCAS, some GI issues can be worsened with autoimmune conditions, but in general aside from that, the... There.
 is an immune system support protocol in my Twitter pin thread. It should be towards the bottom, I believe. It's a gumrow.
 link. If you just enter zero, you can download it for free. It's like seven pages of information that covers the both long COVID and the vaccine injuries.
 to like the immune system, the multiple mechanisms involved. I had written a thread on Twitter about
 management. Let me see if I can find that quickly.
 Okay, so it was I had quoted a newspaper article that said cases of heart attack among youth on the rise
 COVID in 2022. It said monitor for iron access or deficiency. You want to maintain your zinc and copper balance preferably at a one-to-one.
 maintain sufficient magnesium, so about a 6 to 6.5 milligrams per desolid on an RBC magnesium test calcium sodium potassium intake
 Consume DHA and touring daily regularly because that's going to be very anti-diflimatory for the the heart specifically maintain sufficient thiamine intake. So thiamine deficiency can result.
 and not just neurological symptoms, but also cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. So there's multiple forms of berry berry or that's like the name for thiamine deficiency at berry berry.
 There's like wet Barry Barry I forget all the different names for them, but it's It it's covered under thiamine deficiency Regular sun exposure for vitamin D and
 And with MCAS, you want to try to focus mostly on foods, because I know that a lot of supplements and some herbs
 trigger some response in that regard, but it really depends on the individual sensitivity. So like just trying to focus on the foundational basics is going to be a major impact on
 in regards to essentially all those symptoms. Shut off artificial light after sunset to maintain the electronic and cortisol balance. So that's going to be another two major factors in regards to
 those symptoms like cortisol can be very anti-inflammatory and all the tonin as well. And then you want those on the natural circadian rhythm rather than spiking or dropping or just being low all the time.
 Consume sufficient vitamins A. Vitamin A is very important for the immune system just to keep it functioning properly without over activation. Vitamin E, vitamin K2, vitamin B.
 B2, vitamin B3, B6, biotin, full eight, and B12. Protective factors like black seed oil may be a benefit for the cardiovascular system.
 with glycine and vitamin C may also be of benefit there. The aspirin can be a little bit of an issue for people with cell...
 sili sensitivity, but cell siliates are eliminated by the glycine detox pathway. So that's why I always recommend having a little bit of glycine if you ever take aspirin. Exercise becomes important.
 Once the nutrition we repeated as it does strengthen the cardiovascular system over exertion should be avoided in the meantime It's because you don't want to put Stress on an inflamed heart until it's managed a little bit better
 like obviously going for walks and everything but like sprinting extremely heavy lifting where you're going like 100% intensity exercise in general should be
 very important, but you'll want to try to get those foundational factors in place before you do so just so your body's able to handle any of that stress. And then just like the active stress management,
 and also becomes important with GABA support, breathing practice, so prana-yama or breath work, minimizing stressors and life and environment, so it's gonna be highly individual there. Maintaining metabolic health.
 is also extremely important through dietary lights, circadian grounding and lifestyle exercises, exercise practices. The black seed oil in an acetal can also be very helpful in supporting better bowel health.
 But they should they should be used as tools rather than bandages. So the inausital is very helpful in regulating insulin and leptin and then
 bleeding blood glucose levels as well if those are elevated or low. So it keeps them very stable. And then the gut microbiome is obviously going to be a major factor. But if you have symptoms of leaky gut,
 I would focus on managing that first with like Sunlight on the eyes and gut during the sunrise midday and sunset periods the
 Some people can be a little bit sensitive to things like bone broth. So I found meat stock or stews can be very helpful to get some of that glazing and glutamine into the digestive system a little bit better. A lot of...
 to seafood is going to be very not just anti-inflammatory but it'll have the amino acids necessary to repair the gut well.
 depending on the specific, you just mentioned GI issues. So depending on the specific symptoms, prebiotic starches can also be very helpful in regards to repopulating.
 butaric producing bacteria, which has a positive effect on the intestinal lining. And then the, I believe it's called the gut repair protocol. You may not need the full
 zero tolerance dietary framework unless like all of those factors trigger symptoms for you then by all means but there's a lot of good advice in there as well
 Yeah, that should cover a good amount. You want to try to target the foundation more so than individual symptoms because...
 You're just going to be playing a whack and roll pretty much in my experience. Whereas if you target the foundation a lot of those symptoms will subside on the wrong.
 are sprouted almonds okay as part of the zero tolerance dietator from yes the sprouting and
 I can't imagine fermentation would have them tasting very good, but sprouting is a very effective approach for that. That's a joint intending health would be good. I've got a recovering ECL now and I'm trying to...
 keep on trucking with my squat progression. Okay, awesome. Yeah. I'm almost finished with the treatment finally. It's been like a... It's been a crazy busy month. But yeah, I'll get that post as soon as possible.
 Yes, mention and drink a ridiculous amount of spring in mineral water while in cities. Drink probably 75% more than usual while in New York City. Oh man.
 It's such a stark difference in my water consumption and like how hydrate in my mouth will feel From upstate and then being in in the city I just feel
 like I can't drink enough water when I'm in the city just because the the EMF situation is just so dehydrating on the body and then as soon as I leave the city within a few hours to a day it
 It returns back to normal where I'm not just pounding down water all day constantly. It's a very noticeable difference. It's interesting to observe. What are your thoughts?
 nature boys said what are your thoughts on Sarasda Paryla and its benefits haven't been able to find much on your tutor. So Sarasda Paryla is it's more of a tonic and detox herb. I do include it in some of my herbal formulation.
 It's not something that I've talked about fairly often on Twitter or Patreon really. It's just more so something that I really enjoy the taste of. Like Jamaican, Sarsapro...
 is very tasty. It has like almost a sass of fresh taste like root beer. But yeah, it's good for the kidney health.
 It's more so like a tonic or for general sense of energy. I do find it helpful and again like I said it tastes incredible. I will...
 that it can cause a little bit of bowel flushing effect if you consume too much of it once. Pandro said one or two.
 Thank you, ES and Grim for holding these Q&A's you guys are amazing. Thank you very much. KDVS said I developed panic disorder a few months ago after an intensely painful experience.
 regular panic attacks, these episodes last for hours or days. I've been following the GABA protocols in zero tolerance for two months but progress is still slow. Then the other protocols I should be reviewing are things to look into. I saw you say...
 the GABA receptor system takes the longest to recover. Did you mean weeks to months are more like years? So without the support of neuroplasticity, the GABA receptor system,
 Like, for example, if you look at benzodiazepine recovery patients, some of them don't ever return to normal. That's because they are not aware of the importance.
 of nutritional surplus in regards to stress management and the cofactors needed for repairing the body. And then also they become very fearful of anything that has any room.
 So even things like magnesium, which would be very helpful in their situation, they no longer want anything to do with just because they are so afraid of like a potential.
 rebound effect, but in my experience really depends on like if it's just more of a recent experience and it just develops.
 in the last few months. It could be like a three to six month timeline, maximum, could be a couple of weeks that you start noticing major improvements. I couldn't imagine it's gonna be...
 years, unless it's like, I don't want to say like any specific context, but something extremely severe like someone passing away in front of your eyes, something in that regard.
 I'm very sorry if that's what happened, but yeah, it really depends on what exactly you've been following for the game.
 have a protocols because I've outlined a lot of detail in some of them and I don't expect people to follow everything like every single detail but
 the more that you can do the better in that regard. And then a lot of the herbal medicines are extremely helpful.
 friends that I have been joking about Maloon Gulbar on the Twitter timeline, but it was very helpful for one of my friends that was in a very similar situation where he started to develop.
 very severe panic attacks that again lasted for hours or days and maluga bark was very helpful in our regard. Magnolia bark and then just like the basic gabber herbs.
 Blue Lotus can be very helpful in integrating some of that magnesium, D&I, and woodbed knee. Oh, yeah, for the sympathetic nervous system activation question as well. Woodbed knee was very helpful.
 when I was dealing symptoms, very similar to that from CPTSD. That's a... It's an North American Commitive herb, so it has a pretty extent...
 of history but I've never really experienced any side effects hold on my can't keep rubbing up on me I've never experienced any side effects from wood badly. but
 Some people can't experience a little bit of a low blood pressure. So just be aware of that if you struggle with any issues like that. But yeah, the neurogenesis in general will vastly speed up.
 the process of repairing the GABA receptor system just to summarize that whole rant. It shouldn't take years upon years like it normally would.
 Okay, yeah. So ES had linked the shower filter that's the ultimate dual KDF shower filter. That's the one that I had been using.
 There's very expensive shower filters, and that was the middle point that I had found and come across, rather than trying to invest a bunch of money into an apartment that I was living, or townhouse that I was living in.
 Um, Bell said I used to be in a similar position in panic text daily for days at a time and it definitely took a couple of years to start seeing tangible results. Yeah, it really depends on
 like, like PTSD versus CPTSD if it's just one single event. And then there's some factors that go into there. So like the state of the nervous system.
 and the body as a whole before that event occurred can play a major factor, but yeah, it can be very individual for sure.
 Yes, said a lot of issues like this can be a mix of psychological and biological. Yes, yes, it's very important as well. Where the psychological component of it is still present even after mineral, vitamin replacement and serp.
 Plus, it's important to work the trauma from the incident out. My favorite way is to sneak out the deeper meaning of the incident through getting in a safe, peaceful setting and praying about it or trying to release the fear of it happening again to God. Your wave.
 Handling it may be different, but if the core trauma is in dealt with, you will still experience the same symptoms until you become desensitized to the flashbacks in trauma. That's 100% accurate, especially in my experience as well.
 I've talked about here and there on the Twitter timeline, but that shadow work and working through a lot of that trauma is going to be very, very important. That can look different for everyone, so it doesn't always have to be a religious context.
 therapy can be helpful for some people breath work in pranayama some other therapy practices like khriniosacral therapy can have a very profound emotional release
 Some people require things like ketamine therapy that's perfectly fine. Yeah, yeah, he's 100% accurate in that regard. You'll want to try to work through things as you rebuild your foundation.
 Bell said, Pranayama and grounding is basically necessary for me at this point. There are a lot of herbs that have also been helpful too, but the psychological could
 The psychological component is massive. I'm sorry, you can late, but glad to hear you found relief. Thanks for that greatly appreciate it. Will this be recorded anywhere? Yes, yes.
 I'm gonna be making a... I'll probably post up an article just with like a Google Drive links. Just so... I don't think the Craigbot... ...saves.
 the audio files long term. So I just want it to be in a safer place before it gets deleted. um Deki, what are your thoughts on a chronic illness that just felt like it?
 just switched on instantly. Like within 10 minutes going from fine to chronically ill with the autonomic dysfunction shortness of breath, lightheaded and 24-7 symptoms. My question is, what mechanisms could be behind instant chronic illness? So it really depends on...
 the situation, the environment, the context of what was going on before that happened. I had dealt or I had been working with someone that dealt with a very very similar...
 situation, but it rains to like severe full body neuro like neuropathy like
 nervous system feeling like it's on fire constantly buzzing throughout the entire nervous system. He's made a full recovery but it took about took about a year. His situation was very very severe.
 with autonomic nervous system things, it typically doesn't take that long, but it really depends on the context. I would be looking at what the situation is.
 was at hand prior to that trying to target some of those and then just the same basic foundational advice really applies to any health condition and then also as a side note I would not
 just look internally, like within yourself or your life, but also look towards your environment. Like if there's any cell towers that go up, any 5G towers within your vicinity, on that's how you're building if you live in an apartment.
 complex, those can also have a very, very profound effect on your health and it can be like an instant switch, just feeling on top of the world one day and then
 just absolutely terrible the next. So that's going to be another factor that you want to look into. Mold is also another issue that can result in symptoms like that as well.
 So, Alfie Thompson said, I do quite a lot of the things you've suggested. I do seem to have some paradoxical reaction to some things that definitely try to implement everything. Yeah, with the MCAS.
 it makes things a little bit tricky. I'll go through my notes later today and then see if I'm pretty sure I worked with a client that had
 very severe MCAS and working on managing the histamine symptoms not just like very targeted nutrition and then some supplements that they had found they were
 for responsive to without any paradoxical reactions were helpful in that regard as well. But like I had mentioned earlier, the EMF situation, not just in...
 regards to mitochondrial function, but it also really is histamine from mass cells. So that's one of the reasons why I had mentioned it. It's a very common issue in regards to...
 Like people with the MCAS issue typically live in environments with a lot of EMF or major cities. That's not always the case, but it's something to be very mindful of.
 They all you're doing awesome. It's a really great feeling.
 Yeah, if you write about how do you realize everything that you were working with, I would be more than happy to share some of that because...
 More people need need to hear about these types of things. It's not really something that's talked about in Like the health community online It's mostly physical health and fitness that a lot of people talk about and the
 mental and psychological or spiritual health really really falls through the wayside just because it's less common then like gut issues or mild depression or anxiety or just
 like that, like that severe traumatic response on the nervous system can, it's just a lot less common. Yeah, I'd be more than happy to share anything that...
 You'd like to write about. Matt said, I can't find the tweet right now, but it was this picture I developed pretty gnarly at fntasia from the riff.
 period during my teens. I've occasionally experienced come back online after starting in the dial and health. I believe you said you went from one to six ish when healing. Could you say more about that? Yeah so
 I was not aware of it at the time, but in retrospect, there were a lot of indications that I was... Like, there was low level brain damage occurring.
 I was in that very malnourished state and addicted to various types of drugs. Yeah, like during childhood I remember my visualization.
 ability was very very profoundly vivid and by the time I hit my teenage years that was all but gone pretty much and then especially after the brain injury
 no sense of it whatsoever. And then with the neurogenesis protocols and restoring my brain and nervous system health, there was one of the first things I noticed come back. Yeah.
 It may come in cycles for some people, but it's a very good sign that it's coming back online more often. I believe the major factor is just neuroinflammation.
 It has a very doling or dampening effect on those types of processes within the brain or the mind technically. And then neuroplasticity.
 like the ability to really formulate complex thought with it like higher order thinking is very important in that regard as well I believe
 Any tips for a night out? It's my buddy's B day and she has an apartment in Brooklyn going to be up late, potentially on night, lots of blue light. I'm going to start my glucose, PMDD, experiment the night after.
 but sleep is no joke I hate fucking with my circadian rhythm. I'm gonna take a nap beforehand to avoid screens, ground before and after, and maintain my normal nutrition and supplement stuff probably avoid caffeine for a bit after. I used to stay up for days at a time but...
 No, I'm nervous, but I rarely socialize, and that's part of being healthy too. Yeah, I would just have fun. Like you can bring a pair of light blocking glasses, but it might make you a little bit sleepy. Um...
 Yeah, just focus on having fun. And then like the main factor to building up the resilience with your foundation is, you can have fun.
 and while, more regularly than the average person without having to worry about like all of your symptoms returning just from
 One night out like a lot of the people on health Twitter will talk about oh I can't eat out it so and so Or I'll be back to stage zero That's like no resilience what's
 So it really depends on the point that you're at, but I would just focus on having fun. Like you said, the socialization is going to be really, really essential. I can't understate that enough. It's very, very important.
 Yeah, my CPTSD was from repeated malpractices to kid, who was very extreme, which probably not takes long for most. Silasibon is also super helpful for a trauma.
 neurogenesis, but I don't want to just recommend sites to everyone. Yeah, that's a good context warning there. Yeah, some people, like it's the same with the ketamine therapy. I don't
 recommend that to everyone because if you're very prone to mania or psychosis, it can trigger it, but they are very helpful tools if you're not. You don't want to dive into the...
 keep in with anything though, because it may bring up way more than you can handle at once. And then that is, you want to, you want to start in the kitty pool.
 pretty much just for a comparative picture. Dip your toes in and then build up from there, get comfortable with the headspace.
 Yeah, yeah, they can be definitely helpful tools. Okay, so Bell responded the decky chronic illness quest.
 question. Nature boy asked would start the parole be safe to take every day and appreciate your help. Um. Yeah. Yeah.
 the source of parrulla. Sometimes I'll forget about it, but I usually do include it in a lot of my personal herbal blends just because I'm...
 the taste but if you look to the traditional usage it was like a daily tonic herb so I don't really find very... like if there's...
 There's no modern research on it. Looking towards the traditional usage, history is as good as modern research in most regards because if you note, I think I mentioned in the last report.
 If you notice the modern research 99.9% of the time lines up with the traditional
 They tend to be very accurate in my experience. This question, is it possible for HPA access dysfunction to upgrade?
 DHT or Danor Eulith hormones that are supposed to counteract the effects of DHT on the scalp or body here. That's my guess so far to be honest. Yeah, that's what I had meant with DHT nabiii.
 the direct cause but like a downstream effect of stress on the body. So like none of these other compounds or hormones have been tested for in the scalp.
 that I'm aware of. I've obviously haven't looked through the entire PubMed library, but I've taken a fairly in-depth look into some of the other research and...
 Most of it is just in DHT or dihydro testosterone. There seems to be very financial and monetary incentive behind...
 a lot of the research for hair loss and it's very strange to me. So yeah, I do believe that the like cortisol and HPA access dysfunction is going to be...
 more upstream of the increased DHT that can be seen in some studies and other studies like people with low serum DHT will have
 low DHT in the scalp, but they'll still experience this male pattern baldness. So there's not really any mainstream consensus, they just keep. They see that like drugs like the DHT inhibitor.
 working some people and then they're like okay so this is the cause but it goes a little bit deeper than that I think I'm still trying to stress everything out because
 I've been more interested in some of the hormones recently. It's really good at pretending to take a shot and bumping down the ground.
 I'm an expert. Yeah, yeah, having fun once in a while is well worth any small health hit unless you're in a very severe state where
 where any small stressor will completely send you back to square one, then I definitely agree with that. As you're bringing time.
 I think I've just like, expi, found one of the bottles back of my stack, guessing about 10 to 12 months ago. I would say about two to three years. I've had really old bottles that...
 I've had them for like four years. They have been perfectly fine. I've tested them myself, but just as a general guideline for glycerate extractions, about two to three years, it
 senses. If it smells off or like looks strange, then obviously toss it, but in my personal experience I haven't had that issue.
 issue, but I also take a lot of care with the bottles. If it was completely unopened, then it's very likely fine. Adding onto this, I found the cacao.
 Bell recommended a while ago very helpful in providing space to process difficult thoughts though if you don't have sensitivity to The throw Theo bromine. Yes, Kakao is It's a very powerful medicine surprisingly
 There was one point when I was initially beginning my health recovery process where I was eating literally ounces of rock, cow paste every single day.
 I was tweeting about it very often at the time. This was like 2018 or 2019. So a while back, but it's definitely very helpful tool.
 6th seller said, how much caffeine can...
 How much can caffeine effectively even have taken 12 hours before? So my opinion about that has changed a little bit. I have written a pretty long thread on caffeine a few years ago.
 and then I, no, it was like four or five years ago, and then I reposted in 2021 on Twitter. So, there's some factors to go into that. Really depends on your...
 baseline stress level. So how stressed you are on a day to day. How sleep deprived you are. How you metabolize caffeine. So like some people have the genetics to metabolize it.
 very rapidly where it only lasts like two to four hours maybe. And then other people, it can last six plus hours. So there's a genetic component to that. If you have like a
 sleep tracking device I would try that compare with caffeine and without caffeine how much impact it has on your sleep otherwise just go based on how you feel.
 Like if you have Energy waking up in the morning or if you feel groggy or like that usually one of the the frameworks that I use for Gaging how I feel because I don't use sleep tracking the bike
 either is how long it takes for me to like get out of bed and get my brain going in the morning. Some days when I don't get very much sleep that could be...
 like 10, 20 minutes, otherwise I'm just out of bed and getting started on the day. It can be longer for some people depending on the state of their body. But yeah.
 That's typically the main factor that I use to gauge how well I slept. But yeah, the caffeine sensitivity.
 is going to be very highly independent.
 And that said, what you're sharing sounds a lot like me and if you've been lacking a brain damage but I was somewhat in denial or overwhelmed. A DMed you on Patreon recently but I saw a lot of overlap between your background and my own. Appreciate you.
 If you want to send me an email or a message on here, I'll be more inclined to see it. I still need to catch up on these discord messages, private messages. I just... I'm trying to get the shipment out.
 as soon as possible because I missed the period for February and I keep getting emails every single day about when it's so and so going to be in stock so I'm trying to get that back out but
 If you shoot me an email at contact at Grims apothecary that's Grims with two M's dot net or shoot me a message here. I'll get back to you. Any advice for.
 HPA access dysfunction other than the obvious. I believe I had mentioned something about that towards the beginning of this recording.
 You can go back and listen. I think I went pretty extensive on that one. Yeah, a Bojo or BOJ. I don't know how to pronounce it.
 Good. Okay. Okay. Yes. So, yes, responded to the caffeine question as well. Okay.
 is a Spurdy by Medellamp for someone living in the UK. I bought a red light therapy panel thinking that produces the melatonin to sleep but I get the feeling that's not the case. Spurdy lamps are expensive but I'll spend the money if it's important.
 It really depends on your vitamin D levels and the degree of sun exposure you get during the spring and summer.
 And then I suppose your your skin your Fritz Patrick skin type will play a role as well because people with darker skin require more of the UV to stimulate the vitamin D.
 this is. So it really, it's going to be more of an individual thing. But if you get your vitally D levels tested and they're low during the winter, then that would be in the indication that you would be, you would benefit from the vitally.
 I believe Blue Light Diet on Twitter. I believe he has a...
 guide that he has for sale. I think it's pretty cheap. I'll probably, I'll purchase it and take a look over it, but he recommends a...
 how to set up your own breadlight and UV devices, I believe. And that may be a cheaper option than this party. Because that's... It's very pricey. It's very pricey. And that's the main factor in the apprehension I see.
 with the Spurdy Vitamin D lamp. But it's been a very useful tool here in Upstate New York during the winners. Like this winner was, I had made the mistake of taking way too many...
 console calls over the summer and then those could go on for like four to six hours max and then that was the entire time where like peak sun hours so
 I screwed myself over last summer, but it is what it is. The vitamin D lamp was very helpful to get through this winter. Do you know anything about SLCE68?
 for gene genetic results, say I have a faulty serotonin transporter and should avoid SSRIs. I think this means I should also avoid serotonergic substances, but I don't really understand the science. Last question. Any idea where to start if I want to learn more about the body?
 Neurocan and everything we discuss here. Okay, so... Alright, people are heading out. Thank you, ES, for joining us on this call.
 Yeah, I'll wrap up the last of the questions and then we'll wrap this up. So I do I...
 personally have the SLC 6A4 gene as well. I seem to do fairly well in serotonergic substances, but I've never taken an SSRI personally.
 I've just talked with and worked with a lot of people who have and then people who have gone through the process of coming off of them. So that's why I like when I was 15 one of my friends warned me not.
 to like under any circumstances to take any SSRIs when I was going through the psychological or psych met psych hot. All right. Yeah. Yeah.
 uh, psychiatry medical system. Um, yeah, so the uh, you may have a little bit of an issue of clearing out, um,
 I'm pretty sure that's the hold on I think there's a couple formats for the SLC6A4
 Let's see. Yeah, if you find your self sense, it'll leave to...
 allergic compounds or something like that, then obviously try to avoid them or use them, not in excess. And then really focusing on gut health can make a major improvement.
 in that regard as well. So it's essentially like the genetics for an in-body SSRI. So the SSRIs, they try to think of a way to explain.
 this is simple as possible. They pretty much prevent the serotonin transporters from removing serotonin from the brain. And if you have low function of that transporter.
 It's going to have a similar though to not the same extent degree of keeping serotonin within the brain. So if you find yourself sensitive to anything that increases serotonin.
 and by all means but I haven't found that to be the case in my experience. Any idea where to start if I want to learn more about the body and neurochemistry?
 and everything we discuss here. I've been toying with like writing up the very basic guideline for a lot of the major neurotransmitters.
 I'll see what I can do. I didn't read any books or textbooks or anything. I didn't take any classes. I just started reading studies and then discussions online forums.
 line forms and then I would just like any word that I didn't understand I would Google that look at the Wikipedia page or like any simpler explanations and then I began piecing everything together obviously that's not
 very conducive it was very time consuming but yeah I'll start working on something in that regard because I think that would be helpful
 for a lot of newer people. In the meantime, Chad GPT may be helpful. Like it's not always accurate, but it'll give you like a basic rundown on what some of these things mean.
 or just basic definitions. Like the more advanced information is, you can just ask about it here because it's in my experience, Chad GPT and a lot of those.
 AI chats are not 100% accurate. So I don't want to lead you astray with that, but it's good for basic information.
 The
 What are your opinions on something someone feeling worse after using magnetic sleep pad? I have the 20 gals version. It is too much for now. I'm pretty sure that 20 gals is the maximum...
 option that they have that would definitely be way too much for most people I believe I think I have the 10 gals maybe the five gals now actually
 I think I had the 10 Gauss in it, 3Nix, but the 20 Gauss maybe a little bit too powerful, like if you have springs on your
 on your, like if it's a spring box mattress, that could be amplifying the magnetic field into some degree. And then that could be one of the reasons I may depend on your environment.
 as well, but usually the magnetical or magnet, oh, you didn't even say magnetical. Yeah, if it's just some random magnetic sleep pad, then I'm not really positive because, uh...
 The only one that I have experienced with is the Magnetico one. I don't know. These cats. Get out. I'm sorry. Okay, so yeah, it is the Magnetico. Yeah. The
 20 hours maybe too much if none of those factors that I described are relevant to your situation. I would see if you could email them and like swap them out potentially. They may
 have that option available, I'm not positive. Actually, I think I remember a piece of paper that it came with like with a lifetime warranty.
 I'm not positive. Just shoot them over in email and see what they say in that regard. It's my time said I have had a traumatic red null displacement with no less.
 in the eye and the muscle that controls people, dilation is broken so that people's permanently delayed. Cannot see through the eye but register light and have a constant burning and pain as well as weak on that side of the body. Rule what?
 What do you recommend for eye health and specifically how to balance light protocols as not wearing sunglasses is very difficult for example? That one we can talk more privately about that one that
 it's gonna be like a very extensive response there. And we're gonna wrap this call up soon. Yeah, go ahead and shoot me a message and I'll get back to that one, because that one's gonna...
 That one's going to be a little bit more in depth and personalized. Alright, so we'll check the chat.
 Okay, so... Oh, it's my time to sit there, Artemis. Legendary trace.
 said, what seafood do you consume? For example, I eat sardines every day, but nothing other than that, I should probably introduce more. Sardines are pretty solid. I ate a lot of salmon, and then a lot of fresh caught fish from around here, oysters.
 scallops, shrimp once in a while. Yeah, it's usually freshwater and then ocean water fish that my wife's father fishes.
 Her father and her brother, I'm gonna start going fishing with them as well, but Yeah, I try to eat it as fresh as possible just cuz it's available here on the East Coast, but Really any seafood that you have the option
 consume. It's better to do so. Yeah, it's starting to be a terrible option though. They're very solid.
 Okay, so that was the questions in there. All right, so the last question was Remari the rooster I think.
 Yeah, okay Is there a basic stack that you would suggest everyone take every day across the board? No It's gonna be very highly individualized depend on the diet your contacts your environment
 your day-to-day stress, how you respond to some things like with herbs specifically. In general, like the magnesium, meltheonine, and an acetal on black sea dewill, those...
 are generally well received for the majority of people and they have very wide range benefit. Other than that, everything is going to be more individualized.
 in very fun text dependent. Yeah, I've written out about a lot of these contexts on Patreon, but if you have any more specific questions, go ahead and ask them in this group.
 chat but yeah we're gonna wrap up the chat for today. All text yes and make sure that it's scheduled to be open.
 for next week at 9 a.m. and then we'll continue doing these every week and then we'll go from there. All right, thank you for joining everyone. It was very nice talking to you.
 Alright, let's see how do I turn off this record.
